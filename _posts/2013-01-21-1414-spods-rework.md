Did an initial playtest of spods.  Will schedule some more and continue working on it, but I'm also going to start working on a variant with a lot more tiles.  Working title is "Roads, Rails, Rivers & Trails", with a light "map-building" theme and a goal of having the best overall balance of routes using roads, rails, rivers, and trails when someone gets a route of length 7 and ends the game.
