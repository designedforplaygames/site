Yet another new game idea, this one that popped into my head just before bed and somehow got refined while I was asleep: this one is a trick-taking game loosely themed on TV Wrestling, with elements from Bridge and 10-Point Pitch plus a couple of twists thrown in.  No logo or real artwork yet, but here's a prototype card with my crappy art:
