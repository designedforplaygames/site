The Game Crafter has a Miniatures contest, so I'm playing with a couple of ideas for it:

*   Halfling Hunt - a semi-cooperative/competitive game for 2-6 (??) players with elements of a scavenger hunt.

    A gang of 6 halflings went through town stealing ("borrowing!") items from each household.  Your little group is going after them to catch the thieves and hopefully recover the stolen ("borrowed!!!") items.

    As a group, your goal is to tag all six Halflings in their hideaway before they escape.  While you're searching the hideaway, you'll come across the stolen items, each protected by a trap of some sort.  Collect the right stolen items to fulfill a hidden goal before the sixth Halfling is tagged.  Be sure not to let any Halflings escape, or you all lose!

*   SubTerran Skirmish - a tactical battle game for 2-3 players with chinese-checker-like movement.

    Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins - banished from the World Above when magic disappeared, the SubTerran civilizations are now locked in their underground world.  Their only entertainment is the SubTerran Skirmish - a tactical battle in a compact arena where mobility and support are key.
