## who i am

i'm a computer geek and long time board game fan.  i grew up playing board and card games with family, with friends, at high school (mr kennedy's room in high school was the place to go for strategy games!), and continued all through college and ever since.

i'm a unix system administrator by profession, but i hope to keep designing games on the side for as long as my creativity keeps up.
